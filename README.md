## ðŸ“– Project Overview  
This project analyzes students' social media usage and its effects on sleep, mental health, addiction, and academic performance.  

The data comes from a Kaggle dataset containing anonymized records of studentsâ€™ social media behaviors and related life outcomes:  
[Social Media Addiction vs Relationships Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/social-media-addiction-vs-relationships)

## ðŸ›  Skills Demonstrated  

- **SQL Aggregations** â†’ Used `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, and `ROUND()` to calculate averages, totals, and percentages.  
- **Grouping & Ordering** â†’ Applied `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` to analyze patterns across usage levels, platforms, and academic levels.  
- **Conditional Logic** â†’ Leveraged `CASE WHEN` to segment responses (e.g., whether social media affects academics).  
- **Percentage Calculations** â†’ Computed relative proportions of platform usage and academic impacts.  
- **Data Storytelling** â†’ Translated SQL outputs into clear insights and built interactive dashboards in Tableau.
